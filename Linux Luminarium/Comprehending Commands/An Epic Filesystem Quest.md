### Overview

The challenge involves navigating a Unix-based filesystem, interpreting clues hidden in various files, and using specific command-line techniques to avoid triggering traps and self-destructing clues. The goal is to find the hidden flag.

### Steps

1. **Start:**
   We start with a simple directory listing and are immediately presented with a file called `TIP`.

   ```bash
   hacker@commands~an-epic-filesystem-quest:/$ cat TIP 
   ```

   The `TIP` file tells us that the next clue is located in `/usr/share/autoconf/autoscan` and that we must not `cd` into the directory. Instead, we use the `cat` command to view the contents directly.

2. **Navigating Traps:**
   We proceed by using:

   ```bash
   cat /usr/share/autoconf/autoscan/DISPATCH-TRAPPED
   ```

   This file provides the next clue, sending us to `/var/cache`. After exploring this location, we discover a file named `SNIPPET`, which contains another clue.

3. **Hidden Files:**
   Following the clue, we move to `/usr/share/javascript/mathjax/jax/output/CommonHTML/fonts/TeX`, where the clue is hidden in a file starting with a period (`.`). Using `ls -a` to list hidden files, we find `.MEMO`, containing the next hint.

4. **More Navigation:**
   We continue through a series of directories, always being cautious not to trigger traps by reading files directly without navigating into directories. Clues continue to lead us deeper into the filesystem, such as:
   - `/usr/include/selinux/BLUEPRINT`
   - `/opt/ghidra/Ghidra/Processors/HCS12/data/manuals/.REVELATION`
   - `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/angr/procedures/gnulib/__pycache__/POINTER`

5. **Delayed Clue:**
   Upon reaching `/usr/share/wireshark/tpncp`, we find a clue that requires us to enter the directory before it becomes readable. We use the `cd` command, followed by `cat` to read `INFO`.

6. **Final Trap:**
   The last clue brings us to `/opt/linux/linux-5.4/include/config/eeepc`, where we must avoid `cd` and instead use `cat` to read the final trapped file.

   ```bash
   cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/include/config/eeepc/EVIDENCE-TRAPPED
   ```

   This reveals the flag:
