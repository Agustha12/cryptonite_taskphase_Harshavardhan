### Challenge Overview

In this challenge, the objective was to execute the `/challenge/run` script using a relative path after navigating to the correct directory.

### Solution

1. **Initial Error:**
   I attempted to run the script directly from my home directory, which resulted in:

   ```bash
   Incorrect...
   You are not currently in the /challenge directory.
   ```

2. **Navigating to the Correct Directory:**
   I navigated to the `/challenge` directory:

   ```bash
   hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
   ```

3. **Executing with a Relative Path:**
   Once in the correct directory, I ran the script using a relative path (`./run`):

   ```bash
   hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
   ```

   The program validated the relative path and returned the flag:

   ```
   Correct!!!
   Here is your flag:
   pwn.college{srymaFuW89LER0DbYPE9VwLZPje.dFTN1QDLyMTN0czW}
   ```

### Conclusion

The key to this challenge was to navigate to the `/challenge` directory and execute the script using a relative path (`./run`). The flag obtained was:

```
pwn.college{srymaFuW89LER0DbYPE9VwLZPje.dFTN1QDLyMTN0czW}
```
